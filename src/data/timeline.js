This was a really fun experience and the smiles on those elderly peoples faces really made the har work worth it. Because of my good guitar knowlage and fast learning I also took the role of front figure and singer and i had to teach myself a lot of new things in just about a weeks time. This was very much a challange but in the end i managed it all.'

Mostly because of covid that year at first we where supposed to hold activities for kids but that was cansled right untill the last week. So instead we cleaned the space where they hold their karate practice and helped repaint the old building. We also got to use the space to work out when we didnt have anything else to do. I also specialised in marketing for the ads they wanted to put out. Helped out with a instagram account and handed out flyers.'
