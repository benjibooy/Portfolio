                My name is Benjamin Kechmiri i'm a student at NTI Gymnasiet Karlstad in Sweden. Ever since i was a child i loved taking things apart and understanding how they work. I also loved picking things apart and putting them together. I think thats where i got my love for Tech. <br /> 
                Then there is the psychology side. I have seen a lot of my friends struggle with mental health and gotten very little or the wrong kind of help and that needs a change. I know i can't help every kid with their struggles but if i can in the future see to it that my own patients get the best support they can that would make it all worth it. <br />
                I'm a hard worker and especially when i find the field intresting. Like when i started playing the guitar 1 and a half years ago. There hasn't gone a day when i havent had that gutiar in my hands.
